## Signal lights

- Red signal
Traffic control signals are devices placed along, beside, or above a roadway to guide, warn, and regulate the flow of traffic, which includes motor vehicles, motorcycles, bicycles, pedestrians, and other road users.

- Red light
RED—A red signal light means STOP.
A right turn can be made against a red light ONLY after you stop and yield to pedestrians and vehicles in your path. DO NOT turn if there is a sign posted for NO TURN ON RED.

- YELLOW—A yellow signal light warns you that the red signal is about to appear. When you see the yellow light, you should stop, if you can do so safely. If you can't stop, look out for vehicles that may enter the intersection when the light changes.

- GREEN ARROW—A green arrow means GO, but first you must yield to any vehicle, bicycle, or pedestrian still in the intersection. The green arrow pointing right or left allows you to make a protected turn; oncoming vehicles, bicycles, and pedestrians are stopped by a red light as long as the green arrow is lit.
